         <p part="N">WHAT SHE WEARS</p>
         <p part="N">GIFTS-THE BALL GOWNS OF 1896</p>
         <p part="N"> On brisk and gay the autumn has been with weddings, two of which were
            emphatically red-letter functions. Then followed the Horse Show, always a dashing
            affair-a gathering of smart men and women, fine horses and equipages, and showy parade
            of beauty and <rs type="garment">gowns</rs>, boxed off and ticketed for the gazing
            multitudes in genuine peep-show fashion. Men were in their best form, and came in for
            their innings fairly. Gallantry, grooming and good looks told with capital effect in the
            brilliant picture. Now comes the finish of our yearly race, with Christmas shopping on
            the tapis. We are all engaged at this moment in thinking much more about the presents we
            have to make, either from obligation or affection, than of what we are having made to
            wear, or planning to order in the near future, or wearing at the present moment. </p>
         <p part="N">The world will bear witness that we are in our apparel as smart as possible;
            our street <rs type="garment">gowns</rs>, <rs type="garment">hats</rs>, <rs
               type="material">furs</rs> and the rest as faultless and as fit as it is possible to
            have them. The only visible neglect is that we are quite late-and we always are in
            preparing for our toilettes de cérémonie. We shall have to do all that in a rush, as
            January is only three weeks off. But, apropos of the shopping and the gifts, whisper it
            not in Gath that books, pictures, silver, glass, china, etc., are to play a decided
            second fiddle, this year, to <rs type="material">jewels</rs>, <rs type="material"
               >laces</rs> and <rs type="material">furs</rs>, particularly the last of the trio. All
            my cousins and my aunts are talking <rs type="material">fur</rs>, <rs type="material"
               >fur</rs>, <rs type="material">fur</rs>. What wonder, when the creations are so
            lovely! A Christmas list reads off like a menagerie inventory. You will find <rs
               type="material">seal</rs>, <rs type="material">otter</rs>, <rs type="material"
               >monkey</rs>, <rs type="material">beaver</rs> and <rs type="material">bear</rs>; <rs
               type="material">ermine</rs>, <rs type="material">chinchilla</rs>, <rs type="material"
               >mink</rs>, the <rs type="material">lambs</rs> of Persia and Thibet, <rs
               type="material">fox</rs> and <rs type="material">lynx</rs>. By the way, there is a
            new departure in making up <rs type="material">lynx</rs> and <rs type="material"
               >fox</rs> in their natural skins.</p>
         <p part="N">
            <rs type="material">Lynx</rs> abounds in lovely coloring, the <note type="color"
               >yellows</note> paling into <note type="color">white</note>, and the long hairs
            flecked with many shades of <note type="color">gray</note>. Thibet is dyed every color,
            to match different <rs type="material">cloths</rs>, and <note type="material"
               >astrachan</note> has gone a peg higher in exclusiveness than its once proud rival,
               <note type="material"><placeName instant="false" full="yes">Persian</placeName>
               lamb</note>, because the latter is now so well imitated by the manufacturers. The
            medley of <rs type="material">furs</rs> now considered the chic thing has brought about
            a pooling of <rs type="material">furs</rs> in families, by which elder daughters profit,
            and younger ones are better satisfied with newer purchases at less value. De gustibus
            non. </p>
         <p part="N"> Now for un petit mot about ball and <rs type="garment">dinner gowns</rs>, for
            the dinner-dance season is staring us in the face. We all know the succés of <rs
               type="material">flowers</rs> and <rs type="material">tulle</rs> last year, and we are
            glad to learn that both are to reign in ninety-six. All kinds of <rs type="material"
               >nets</rs>, <rs type="material">gauzes</rs>, lisses, and the newest and sheerest of
               <rs type="material">grenadines</rs>, flowered like watercolored pictures. I hope the
            débutantes at the coming Patriarchs will scorn <rs type="material">silks</rs> and <rs
               type="material">satins</rs> for their gowns and pay tribute to their own youth and
            beauty in <rs type="material">tulle</rs>, the ideal <rs type="garment">frock</rs> for
            that enchanting occasion.</p>
         <p part="N"> The rosebud element will monopolize the strictly floral <rs type="garment"
               >gowns</rs> they are theirs by natural right, but all young women, matrons or maids,
            it is to be hoped, will array themselves in them for the beauty and becomingness of this
            poetic fashion. </p>
         <p part="N">As an example of devotion to a <rs type="garment-piece">flower</rs>, the <rs
               type="garment">gown</rs> in question is trimmed with <rs type="material"
               >myosotis</rs> or <rs type="material">forget-me-nots</rs>. There are two immensely
            full <rs type="garment-piece">skirts</rs> of <rs type="color">white</rs>
            <rs type="material">tulle</rs> falling over a <rs type="garment-piece">gupe</rs> of
            white soie de Lyons, and all three skirts are gathered on one band. The <rs
               type="material">tulle</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">skirts</rs> are hemmed, with a <rs type="garment-piece">vine
               heading</rs> embroidered in <rs type="color">white</rs>
            <rs type="material">floss</rs>, exceedingly dainty and effective. The <rs
               type="garment-piece">collet</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">corsage</rs>, draped in <rs type="material">double tulle</rs>,
            rises into a slight point, back and front, and is headed by a full <rs
               type="garment-piece">garland</rs> of <rs type="material">forget-me-nots</rs>, which
            form <rs type="garment-piece">shoulder straps</rs> to the <rs type="garment-piece"
               >bodice</rs>. The <rs type="garment-piece">sleeves</rs> are made of many thicknesses
            of <rs type="material">tulle</rs> caught under the flowers on the <rs
               type="garment-piece">shoulders</rs> and draped so as to expose the arm in front, and
            then draped fully into the armhole in a bouffant way. The <rs type="garment-piece"
               >sleeve</rs> is finished at the elbow by a band of a <rs type="color">sky-blue</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs>, matching the <rs type="garment-piece">bouquets</rs>
            which are coquettishly fastened on the outside. <rs type="garment-piece">garland of
               myosotis</rs> is worn round the throat, and connected from this <rs
               type="garment-piece">gorgette</rs> to the <rs type="garment-piece">décolletage</rs>
            are <rs type="garment-piece">eight floral chains</rs>, slender and lovely; three in the
            back, three in the front, and short ones on each shoulder, which fit over the neck
            perfectly. The <rs type="garment-piece">girdle</rs> is of <rs type="color">sky-blue</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs>, fastened in the <rs type="garment-piece">back</rs> with
            a smart <rs type="garment-piece">bow</rs>. <rs type="color">white</rs>
            <rs type="garment">aigrette</rs>, supported by <rs type="garment-piece">a knot</rs> of
            forget- me-nots, is posed a little to one side of the head, the hair being dressed in
            waves, rolled off from the face, and pretty, careless coils in the back running up into
            a little knot, with a drooping wave curled in the middle of the forehead.</p>
         <p part="N"> Another charming gown has floral effects derived from exquisite <rs
               type="material">silk</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">embroideries</rs>, the newest of the fine trimmings. A <rs
               type="material">satin</rs>
            <rs type="material">skirt</rs> is the foundation usually for these <rs
               type="garment-piece">transparent draperies</rs> of <rs type="material">tulle</rs> or
               <rs type="material">gauzes</rs> favored by matrons young and beautiful. </p>
         <p part="N">The skirt, in this instance, is <note type="color">cream-white</note> satin,
            and the tulle overdress a <note type="color">pinkish-mauve</note>, but instead of being
            hemmed is only doubled, then gathered at the waist, and afterward shirred a little
            distance, say nine or ten inches below, and drawn down snugly to the figure and tacked
            to the <note type="material">satin</note> gupe. Two broad bands of <note type="material"
               >silk</note> embroidery, roses in every shade, start en tablier at the bottom of the
               <note type="material">tulle</note>
            <rs type="garment">skirt</rs> and are graduated a little toward the <rs
               type="garment-piece">waist</rs>, leaving space for a pointed <rs type="garment"
               >girdle</rs> of the same embroidery to show between and encircle the <rs
               type="garment-piece">waist</rs> in a narrow <rs type="garment">belt</rs>, fastening
            on the left panel with a <rs type="garment">bouquet</rs> of <rs type="material"
               >violets</rs>. <rs type="garment-piece">Corsage bébé</rs>, <rs type="garment-piece"
               >V-shaped décolletage</rs>, headed by a broad <rs type="garment-piece">band</rs> of
            this lovely lisse embroidery, with bouquet of violets on the left shoulder. <rs
               type="color">White</rs> satin <rs type="garment-piece">elbow sleeves</rs> draped with
               <rs type="material">tulle</rs> so as to show the inner side of the arm, across which
            are two <rs type="garment-piece">narrow straps</rs> of <rs type="material"
               >embroidery</rs>. Hair dressed low on the face, a few short curls in the back, and
            run through the top a superb <rs type="garment">jeweled hairpin</rs>, a triple <rs
               type="material">diamond</rs>
            <rs type="garment">aigrette</rs>. The <rs type="garment">necklace</rs> is an almost
            invisible gold chain, from which is suspended three enormous <rs type="material"
               >jewels</rs>, a <rs type="material">diamond</rs> in the centre, with <rs
               type="material">ruby</rs> and <rs type="material">emerald</rs> on sides.</p>

         <p part="N"> BEAUTIFUL BE-FEATHERED OPERA MATINEE HATS - ONLY BOX OCCUPANTS MAY DISPLAY
            THEIR HATS DURING PERFORMANCE - NATTIER MODEL COMMENDED COSTUMES FOR CALLING AN
            ESPECIALLY PRETTY SHORT SKIRT MODEL — BRONZE AND OLIVE GREENS POPULAR- UNDEFINED
            PLAIDSFEATHER ARRANGEMENTS </p>
         <p part="N">An opera matinee is sure at all times to bring out the street fashions in
            strong force. Particularly true is it at the November opening, and this year it has
            proved a brilliant example. The beplumed <rs type="garment">hats</rs> assisted with
            telling effects. It is one thing to pass on the street these showy long <rs
               type="garment-piece">plumes</rs> in <rs type="color">white</rs>, in <rs type="color"
               >blue</rs>, in <rs type="color">pink</rs> and <rs type="color">yellows</rs>, and
            quite another to sit from two to three hours gazing at them from time to time. <rs
               type="material">Feathers</rs> in tips seem to have almost disappeared. In half
            lengths they are now disposed at most audacious angles, and bunched up into threes or
            fives. They plunge out from the left side of <rs type="material">velvet</rs>
            <rs type="garment">hats</rs> with <rs type="garment-piece">upturned brims</rs> in a
            rearward direction that is most original. They rise from uptilted and very much trimmed
            backs of hats in stunning bravado. They cross the <rs type="garment-piece">crowns</rs>
            of smart hats from one side almost to the other, and over, and sweep quite far forward
            upon others. As for the <rs type="garment-piece">under brim</rs>
            <rs type="material">feather</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">linings</rs>, as well as the tosssed up <rs
               type="garment-piece">crown groupings</rs> turning this way and that, they all bespeak
            a skill for posing, and a control over the <rs type="material">feather</rs> that never
            has been as complete as it is this season. The pity of it all was to see these exquisite
            perishable creations taken off and held on the laps. The box contingent is in that
            respect to be envied for keeping the hat on the head.</p>
         <p part="N">BOX HAT IN PINK</p>
         <p part="N"> The charming Nattier styles, and the very low crowned Watteaux should become a
            fixed opera and <rs type="garment">theatre hat</rs>, so easy are they to take off and
            put on, and of the least trouble to keep on one's lap, for <rs type="garment-piece"
               >plumes</rs> and <rs type="material">feather</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">trimmings</rs> rightfully belong to those in seats where hats
            may be worn on the head throughout the performance. Beautiful were many of the <rs
               type="garment">box hats</rs>. For instance, one in <rs type="color">pink</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs>, with a side tilt that seemed every moment to be losing
            its balance, had its <rs type="garment-piece">brim</rs> lined with <rs type="color"
               >pink</rs>
            <rs type="material">tinsel cloth</rs> covered with <rs type="color">pink</rs>
            <rs type="material">tulle</rs>. Five half length <rs type="color">pink</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">plumes</rs> toppled over its <rs type="garment-piece"
               >crown</rs> and hid it completely. The <rs type="garment-piece">brim</rs> in the rear
            of the <rs type="garment-piece">crown</rs> was also invisible, but in front there was a
            glimpse of it bent down upon the hair and on the right side. The shape of the head as
            well as the dressing of the hair counts for everything in hat styles of this character.
            Another irresistible fascinator was in <rs type="color">white</rs>
            <rs type="material">felt</rs>, and had its <rs type="garment-piece">crown</rs>, which
            was rather high and covered with a fold drapery of <rs type="color">straw-colored</rs>
            <rs type="material">chiffon velvet</rs> further ornamented on the extreme edge in the
            back with a long and compact bunch of <rs type="color">silvery white</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">aigrettes</rs> spreading backward with a dash. The right side
            edge of the <rs type="garment-piece">brim</rs> of this hat almost touched the beauty's
            eyebrow, while on the left, the uptilt showed off the whole head. At the same marvellous
            angle was posed a <rs type="color">white silver </rs>
            <rs type="material">cloth</rs> creation, showing its sheen only upon the <rs
               type="garment-piece">brim</rs>. The <rs type="garment-piece">crown</rs> was extremely
            large, having a wrinkled <rs type="garment-piece">drapery</rs> of <rs type="color">pale
               blue</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs> very full and gracefully disposed. In the most
            picturesque manner were <placeName instant="false" full="yes">France</placeName>
            <rs type="material">roses</rs> in their dainty <rs type="color">pinkness</rs>, grouped
            into a <rs type="garment-piece">garland</rs> on the left, a few <rs type="material"
               >roses</rs> swinging below the <rs type="garment-piece">brim line</rs> on that side
            which was abridged for that particular effect evidently. For pure coquetry no hat has
            ever excelled it. </p>
         <p part="N">NEW COIFFURE</p>
         <p part="N"> One <rs type="garment">coiffure</rs> there was that stood out from all the
            rest on a recent night performance. It consisted of two large <rs type="color"
               >scarlet</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet tiger lilies</rs> grouped with two or three <rs type="color"
               >dull green</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet leaves</rs>, and a <rs type="garment-piece">Paradise
               plume</rs> of <rs type="color">silvery whiteness</rs> springing from the midst. This
               <rs type="garment">coiffure</rs> was posed slightly out of the middle line on the
            back of the head (the hair being dressed high), but leaning a trifle toward the left
            side. A copy it is said to be of a <rs type="garment">coiffure</rs> worn at the popular
               <placeName instant="false" full="yes">French</placeName> play called La Belle Madame
            Héber. It marks a new departure, taking the place of a <rs type="garment">theatre
               hat</rs>. </p>
         <p part="N">There seems to be no chance, however, this season to oust the famous large <rs
               type="garment">picture hats</rs>, or the smaller styles just described. What may
            happen in the autumn of 1906 remains to be seen.</p>
         <p part="N">SMART THINGS HIGH-PRICED</p>
         <p part="N"> If ever there was a time when so-called poor relations might joyfully accept
            presents of things wearable, it is undoubtedly this year. The advance in prices for
            really smart <rs type="garment">hats</rs>, <rs type="garment">costumes</rs>, <rs
               type="garment">evening wraps</rs>, <rs type="garment">sets</rs> of <rs
               type="material">furs</rs>, or of <rs type="material">ostrich</rs> and <rs
               type="material">marabou</rs> puts the small-income sisters, aunts and cousins of the
            rich in quite a trying situation. No small economies can overcome the rise to the
            fabulous sums that are asked at the smart places. </p>
         <p part="N">HALF TAILORED STREET COSTUMES</p>
         <p part="N">
            <rs type="garment">Street costumes</rs> for forenoon wear are worn short, and will be.
            But there are <rs type="garment">cloth costumes</rs> only half-tailored, which are quite
            elaborate, and expensively trimmed, the skirts of which are long. These are, of course,
            specially intended to pay visits in, or to wear upon any ceremonious occasion. Ladies'
            or <rs type="garment">chiffon cloths</rs> in single colors are for these, the best
            style. The length of the <rs type="garment">skirt</rs> indicates that the wearer, if she
            walks, must take it up. Hansom and cab-hire has become so general nowadays that few will
            be inclined to go through the weariness of carrying their <rs type="garment">skirts</rs>
            in the grasp of the hand. Many dressy <rs type="material">cloths</rs> and <rs
               type="material">velveteens</rs> in <rs type="garment-piece">short-skirted</rs>
            <rs type="garment">costumes</rs> mark the independence of those who are to make their
            calls afoot in the season. </p>
         <p part="N">A <rs type="garment">SHORT SKIRT</rs> MODEL</p>
         <p part="N"> When a choice has to be made among the short-skirted tailor-mades the many
            models shown are so charming that it becomes a difficult matter to order. There are
            complex designs that appear quite simple in the sober colors, but are very ornate in <rs
               type="material">cloths</rs> of lighter shades. A long <rs type="garment-piece"
               >tab</rs> design, cut in one piece with the <rs type="garment-piece">yoke</rs> or
            with the <rs type="garment-piece">Princess girdle top</rs> , is extremely graceful, as
               <rs type="garment-piece">full plaits</rs> are set in to suit the figure or lessened
            as the demand arises. <rs type="garment-piece">Braids</rs> to match the cloth or glossy
               <rs type="color">black</rs>
            <rs type="material">silk</rs> ones in some way or another enter into the bottom <rs
               type="garment">skirt trimming</rs>. It is kept in most cases quite low on the bottom,
            and not at all conspicuous, the main object being not to detract from the length of <rs
               type="garment-piece">skirt line</rs>. Passementerie motives are introduced with
            soutaches, while wider braids produce of themselves sufficient effect. </p>
         <p part="N">BODICE TREATMENT</p>
         <p part="N"> The close-fitting <rs type="garment">bodices</rs> receive color bits upon
            their revers, mostly very small ones, or have flat shapes in color laid on about the
            neck, lower down upon the <rs type="garment-piece">belt</rs>, and both in front and in
            the back, as well as upon the bottom of the <rs type="garment-piece">sleeves</rs>.
            Buckle ornaments are put in pairs upon the <rs type="garment">belts</rs> or as an
            ornament on the top of <rs type="garment-piece">princess girdles</rs> both back and
            front. This finish is a very smart one. All the <rs type="garment">bodices</rs> keep up
            either Eton or <rs type="material">bolèro</rs> suggestions. A few exceptions adopt the
               <rs type="garment-piece">basque line</rs> or the <rs type="garment-piece"
               >postilion</rs>, but these are not found among the younger slim figures. <rs
               type="garment-piece">Shoulders</rs> are, or should be, kept on broad lines; there is
            no style without that feature in tailor-mades. Some <rs type="garment-piece"
               >sleeves</rs> have less fulness than others at the top. Both long and elbow <rs
               type="garment-piece">sleeve</rs> lengths are worn. </p>

         <p part="N"> Among some extremely late coming tailor models long sleeves prevail, <rs
               type="material">Lace</rs>
            <rs type="garment">chemisettes</rs> give rise to openings at the neck that are
            exceedingly becoming, and stands for no end of smartness in these costumes. </p>
         <p part="N"><rs type="color">BRONZE</rs> AND <rs type="color">OLIVE GREEN</rs></p>
         <p part="N"> As the season advances <rs type="color">bronze</rs> and <rs type="color">olive
               green</rs>s increase in color distinction among the <rs type="material">cloths</rs>
            and <rs type="material">velvets</rs>. An example in <rs type="color">olive green</rs> in
            the finest of <rs type="material">cloth</rs>, had for trimming, an inch and a half <rs
               type="color">black</rs>
            <rs type="material">brocade</rs>
            <rs type="material">galoon</rs>. It was a <rs type="garment">two-piece suit</rs>, a
            closed Eton and skirt. This galoon from <rs type="garment-piece">shoulders</rs> to <rs
               type="garment-piece">hem</rs> in front gave long lines in even rows, the <rs
               type="material">cloth</rs> between being cut into a flat flap, which raised itself
            sufficiently to keep the width of the <rs type="material">galoon</rs> intact In the back
            these long lines were pre-served, giving a tapering effect to the <rs
               type="garment-piece">waist</rs> which was belted in with cloth to match, but also had
            shaped oblong applications of light <rs type="color">grayish-blue</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs>, over which were motives of <rs type="color">black</rs>
            <rs type="material">silk</rs>
            <rs type="material">passementerie</rs>. A turn-over <rs type="garment-piece"
            >collar</rs>, now the accepted finish of all the best tailor-mades, and in this instance
            it was not wanting. It was also of <rs type="color">blue</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs>, over-applied with <rs type="color">black</rs>
            <rs type="material">passementerie</rs>. The bottom of the sleeves repeated the same
            ornamentation, while upon the fronts of the Eton, on the <rs type="garment-piece">bust
               line</rs>, were two <rs type="color">black</rs> pieces similarly treated. Charming
            indeed was this <rs type="garment-piece">trimming</rs> effect, while the <rs
               type="material">galoon</rs> in its glossy flatness seemed to be woven into the <rs
               type="material">cloth</rs>, so admirably was it sewed and pressed. </p>
         <p part="N"><rs type="color">TOBACCO-BROWN</rs> COSTUME</p>
         <p part="N"> Of the utmost attractiveness was a <rs type="color">tobacco-brown</rs>
            <rs type="material">cloth</rs> costume, short skirted, as well, with a low crutch design
            separating the <rs type="garment-piece">plaits</rs>, and in the same brown shade as the
            cloth. On one edge of this <rs type="color">brown</rs>
            <rs type="material">silk</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">Hercules braid</rs> was a narrow raised <rs type="color"
               >brown</rs>
            <rs type="material">satin</rs>
            <rs type="material">cord</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">gimp</rs>, which, when sewed on, gave a special accent to the
            long <rs type="garment-piece">crutch lines</rs> that ran up from the bottom, and were
            lost in their diminutive ending. A panel front had the <rs type="material">cloth</rs>
            cut into graded crescent lengths from top to bottom, a darker shade of <rs type="color"
               >brown</rs>
            <rs type="material">silk</rs> showing underneath. Crescent was finished by the narrowest
               <rs type="material">cord</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">inlet</rs> and stitched to flatness. </p>
         <p part="N">The same <rs type="garment-piece">trimming</rs> displayed itself upon the sides
            of the sleeves from shoulder to cuff, and gave a <rs type="garment-piece">yoke</rs> line
            back and front, in three graded rows beautifully proportioned in their size. A touch of
               <rs type="color">gold</rs>
            <rs type="material">galoon</rs> brightened up the turn-over <rs type="color">brown</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs> collar, as it did the straight <rs type="garment-piece"
               >cuff</rs> pieces; while a glimpse of both <rs type="material">velvet</rs> and <rs
               type="color">gold</rs> suggested an inner <rs type="garment">vest</rs> line in
            perfect harmony. All the fastenings in front were quite invisible. </p>
         <p part="N"> INDEFINITE PLAIDS </p>
         <p part="N">Those almost undefined <rs type="color">plaid</rs> cloths in <rs type="color"
               >greens</rs> or <rs type="color">bronze</rs> with <rs type="color">red</rs>dish and
               <rs type="color">dark blue</rs>ish <rs type="garment-piece">shad-braids</rs> of <rs
               type="material">silk</rs>en <rs type="color">black</rs>ness are twisted into a
            telling design upon each side of this straight band. A Norfolk style of short belted-in

            <rs type="material">cloth</rs>

            and a few <rs type="garment-piece">gilt buttons</rs> laid upon the <rs type="garment"
               >belt</rs> and the fronts produce a markedly good and out-of- the-common style.</p>

               >cape</note> on this <note type="velvet">velvet</note>
            <note type="garment">wrap</note> give it its animation</p>

         <p part="N">On these three models, the motion of the mode is obtained in three ways-by
            swinging jabots on the <note type="material">velveteen</note>
            <note type="garment">frock</note> at the left, by circular cut in the <note
               type="material">broadcloth</note> model in the middle, and by the wide semicircular
            front of the <note type="material">velours</note>
            <note type="garment">coat</note> at the right </p>

         <p part="N">FLARES that spring from the front, the side, or the back, the circular swing of
               <note type="garment">coat</note>s, the sweep of new <note type="garment"
            >cape</note>s, the flying lines of the jabot and the scarf, have all called into being a
            new mode--the mode of motion. The straight silhouette of past seasons was inert, static.
            The new, flared line is a living, moving, modern thing. The rough sketches on these two
            pages, showing clothes that smart women are wearing now, illustrate this theme of
            motion. The unfinished lines of these sketches, which have not as yet settled into
            repose, express the ever-shifting grace of the mobile silhouette. This is the impression
            presented by the new flaring fashions. Every step, every move displaces a godet, a
            pleat, a drapery, and sets astir a new dynamic rhythm.</p>
         <p part="N">It has been a long time making its way-this mode of motion. This winter marks
            its first general acceptance. We clung for a long time to the straight, restricted line,
            because it gave us so little trouble. It was young. It was simple. It was smart because
            it was simple and young. And, as long as we kept to it tenaciously, we could not go very
            far wrong.</p>
         <p part="N">But what has this new flared line to offer to offset the security of the old,
            familiar, tube-like silhouette? Vogue believes that it has a great deal to give in the
            furthering of a more progressive mode. Its first great advantage is its comfort. The
            straight line was made for standing still in a strenuous world keyed to motion. The
            flared line is designed for easy, unrestricted action. The new silhouette makes us less
            self-conscious about our clothes-walking, sitting, dancing-and more conscious of a new
            and exhilarating freedom and grace. Moreover, as long as the straight silhouette
            dominated clothes, the mode itself could not go forward. When two seams made a dress,
            what was left to encourage the invention of a Vionnet, who works with fabrics as a
            sculptor moulds his planes? What was left to stimulate the plastic skill of a Jean
            Patou, the kinetic, or made-for-motion, designs of a Lucien Lelong, the genius of all
            the designers to whom the making of clothes is an art expressive of its age?</p>
         <p part="N"> Within the new conception of the flare, there is no end to the variations that
            are possible. The precisely tailored <note type="material">tweed</note>
            <note type="garment">frock</note>, with its concealed pleats that flare only in motion,
            the <note type="material">chiffon</note> dress with its flying scarfs and floating
            panels, are both in the same modern spirit. But each meets in its own way the demands of
            its fabric and the needs of the occasion for which it is especially intended. Not only
            does the flared silhouette give a wider scope to the designer, but it offers more
            individuality to the woman who wears it. While the straight line was becoming to the
            great majority-to the average woman and the average figure-,it had little to give to the
            exception. The woman whose charm is her dignity comes into her own this year, because
            she chooses the type of flare that will emphasize that quality. On the other hand, the
            slight, young girl now wears the new moulded lines, clinging and then flaring, short and
            free, to accent every lithe line. She adopts the Greek grace of a Diana, not of a
            Minerva-and the new mode offers both. The tall woman chooses clothes that will tend to
            shorten the effect of length. Even a short woman finds the particular kind of flowing
            lines that will make her look less square. The skilful use of flares can be made to
            bring out one's good points and to minimize less fortunate ones.</p>
         <p part="N">With the coming of the flare, we begin a new era of individuality-altogether
            modern, a little dangerous, and always interesting. There is no longer any single
            formula for chic. And just how the flare is to be adapted to its time and to its wearers
            is a story to be continued in many more issues of Vogue in the weeks to come.</p>

         <p part="N"> Many happy returns to the Debutante Party (even without the old fine “careless
            rapture”). There is hardly one Debutante who does not include, in her daily schedule,
            work for some of the great relief needs, college course, Nurse Aid or Day Nursery work.
            But over this layer of serious ideas and genuine good works there is again this year the
            light but delicious frosting of debutante parties. Most of them will again be the great
            group presentation balls which were wartime innovations but there will be a few
            individual parties. The debutante this year may still not have a seven man escort as her
            mother might have had ; she will quite probably rush down for college for her own debut;
            there will be fewer fittings, fewer debutante luncheons, much, much less flurry. And
            although clothes may seem less important to her than to her pre-war debutante
            predecessors , she will probably manage to affix her personal signature to her own
            wardrobe; will know that it is not “ how many” but “how memorable” that really matters,
            when she chooses her clothes. With her beautiful <rs type="color">white</rs> Coming Out
               <rs type="garment">party dress</rs> this season a debutante may wear a short <rs

               type="color">white</rs> , and carry a tight little white furs (opposite page). If it
            is not her coming out party,she will probably choose a colour. When it is not a party,
            but just a small dancing evening dress again, this season … <rs type="color">black</rs>
            perhaps...bare on top as her debut dress. <note type="image"> Image </note> WHITE TO

               sophisticated. What does it: fabric with more character, patterns with more strength,
