            <p>Debututante</p>

            <p> Many happy returns to the Debutante Party (even without the old fine “careless
               rapture”). There is hardly one Debutante who does not include, in her daily schedule,
               work for some of the great relief needs, college course, Nurse Aid or Day Nursery
               work. But over this layer of serious ideas and genuine good works there is again this
               year the light but delicious frosting of debutante parties. Most of them will again
               be the great group presentation balls which were wartime innovations but there will
               be a few individual parties. The debutante this year may still not have a seven man
               escort as her mother might have had ; she will quite probably rush down for college
               for her own debut; there will be fewer fittings, fewer debutante luncheons, much,
               much less flurry. And although clothes may seem less important to her than to her
               pre-war debutante predecessors , she will probably manage to affix her personal
               signature to her own wardrobe; will know that it is not “ how many” but “how
               memorable” that really matters, when she chooses her clothes. With her beautiful <rs

               a debutante may wear a short <rs type="color">crimson</rs>

               <rs type="material">furs</rs> (opposite page). If it is not her coming out party,she
               will probably choose a colour. When it is not a party, but just a small dancing <rs

            <p>Almost every debutante comes out in <rs type="color">white</rs>--but for all the
               other parties she will probably choose colour. She might choose one colour, make it
               hers. Might, for instance, wear <rs type="color">grey</rs>
               <rs type="material">jersey</rs> in the daytime, <rs type="color">shadowy grey</rs> at
               night. Or young-<rs type="color">black</rs>, all hours. Here two pretty, fresh
               debutantes in New York wear the non-white party dresses they chose. Both are tall,
               with a specifically American beauty; both at Barnard; both making their debuts
               Devember 1 at the Governor Neighborhood House Ball at the Ritz.</p>
