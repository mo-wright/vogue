            <p>Pretty color; easy fashion</p>
            <p>TOGETHER AGAIN!</p>

            <p>News at night, right—the look of a <rs type="garment">top</rs> and, instead of <rs
                  type="garment">pants</rs>, a <rs type="garment">long slim skirt</rs>—this season’s
               newest “pijama dressing!” Here’s Geoffrey Beene’s super-soft, north-of-south-version—
                  <rs type="color">blue</rs>-eyed, <rs type="color">gray-pink</rs> plaid <rs
                  type="material">silk crepe</rs>. Geoffrey designed the <rs type="garment-piece"
                  >shirt-and-sash-side</rs> and one of his new <rs type="garment">T-shirt-based
                  tops</rs>. And a beautiful way it unwraps—beautifully. Gianfranco Ferré, about
               $950. At Lord &amp; Taylor, <placeName>N.Y.</placeName>; Gattle’s, <placeName>Bal
                  Harbour</placeName>; <placeName>Magnin</placeName>; Liberty House,
                  <placeName>Hawaii</placeName>. Accessories and men’s fashion details, next to last
               page. These 12 pages: hair, Harry King of Cinandre; makeup, Way Bandy.</p>

            <p>The kind of dress a lot of women have been beating the bushes for years, left— a
               short, simply pretty late-day/little- <rs type="garment">dinner dress</rs>— <rs
                  type="color">banana</rs>
               <rs type="material">silk crepe de Chine</rs>, <rs type="garment-piece"
                  >bare-necked</rs>, with <rs type="garment-piece">sleeves</rs> that just slip off
               the shoulder. Monty Susman for Mollie Parnis; Altair, Coondogale Silk Company. About
               $385. Bergdorf Goodman; Saks; Neiman-Marcus; Lillie Rubin—South and West; Swanson’s.
               A reminder: those woodsy, misty scents for men (Aramis for one) are a nice
               mood-changer at night. And who knows, maybe your scents won’t clash.</p>

         <div type="page" n="2">

            <p>Part of the fashion idiom: “easy dressing”—meaning dressing that’s unstudied,
               uncomplicated, easy to wear… all in an attractive, polished, real-life way. The
               concept’s American. We started it. We do it best. And we keep doing it better. This
               season, “easy” goes to a whole new level—racier, sharper, more sophisticated. What
               does it: fabric with more character, patterns with more strength, more precision…
               color!</p>

            <p>There’s a new character to Ralph Lauren’s sportier American classics, like his
               traditional <rs type="garment">trousers</rs>, this page, are in a bold floral print
               of <rs type="material">silk</rs>, and his <rs type="garment">shawl-collared
                  “robe”</rs> is vivid <rs type="color">purple</rs> in soft, languorous <rs
                  type="material">silk charmeuse</rs>. Another plus: these looks needn’t wait for
               warm weather, a resort—this is terrific at-home dressing any time. <rs type="garment"
                  >Trousers</rs>, about $358. <rs type="garment">Robe-jacket</rs>, about $658. Late
               Dec. at Saks Fifth Avenue, <placeName>NYC</placeName>; Hudson-Belk’s,
                  <placeName>Raleigh NC</placeName>; Polo/Ralph Lauren, <placeName>San
                  Antonio</placeName>. Ring and bracelet, Paloma Picasso for Tiffany &amp; Co.

            <p>Everybody loved the look, the Fred Astaire nonchalance of Ralph Lauren’s impeccable,
               classic <rs type="garment">trousers</rs>… in brilliant <rs type="color">chrome</rs>
               <rs type="material">silk charmeuse</rs>, opposite. Here, played against a <rs

               <rs type="garment">jacket</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>
               <rs type="garment">tank</rs>. <rs type="garment">Trousers</rs>, about $358. <rs
                  type="garment">Jacket</rs>, about $396. Late December at Barneys <placeName>New
                  York</placeName>; Polo/Ralph Lauren, <placeName>Costa Mesa CA</placeName>;

            <p>A STRONG SENSE OF EASE</p>

            <p>Typical of this “laid back” American approach: very polished sweater-and-skirt
               dressing for low-key evenings. And what a sweater-and-skirt this is! By Ralph Lauren,
               this page, a long, soft-moving, bias-cut skirt of flag-red <rs type="material">silk
                  crepe de Chine</rs> with a generously sized <rs type="color">navy</rs>
               <rs type="material">cotton</rs>
               <rs type="garment">turtleneck sweater</rs>. The <rs type="garment">turtleneck</rs>—so
               important this winter—keeps evolving for warm weather, with <rs type="garment-piece"
                  >long sleeves</rs>, <rs type="garment-piece">short sleeves</rs>, even on <rs
                  type="garment-piece">halters</rs>. <rs type="garment">Skirt</rs>, about $258. <rs
                  type="garment">Sweater</rs>, about $198. Turnout late December at Allcott &amp;
               Andrews, NYC; Short Hills NJ; Hartford CT; Washington DC; Polo/Ralph Lauren, Atlanta;
               Polo/Ralph Lauren, Ft. Lauderdale. Elizabeth Jackson chair for Arc International,
               Inc., NYC.</p>

            <p>Pure pow! The dress everybody applauded, wanted!—Donna Karan’s—opposite. In
               double-faced, full-bodied <rs type="color">bright red</rs>
               <rs type="material">silk</rs>— strong shouldered, tightly cinched at the <rs
                  type="garment-piece">waist</rs>, with a graceful, ankle-length <rs type="garment"
                  >skirt</rs>—it sets up a whole new definition of shape and kind of dressing for
               easy evenings. Donna Karan New York. About $890. Late December. At Bloomingdale’s,
               L.H. Rogers, Salem MA; Alexander’s, Virginia Beach; Hudson’s, Hattie; Palm Beach FL
               and Scottsdale AZ; Eleanor Keeshan, Los Angeles. Chair, Lawrence Originals, c. 1960,

            <p>A STRONG SENSE OF EASE… PATTERNS ARE PRECISE, SHARP—UNSENTIMENTAL</p>

            <p>The best of these patterns, when they aren’t in strong color, are in strong <rs
                  type="color">black</rs> or <rs type="color">navy</rs> with <rs type="color"
                  >white</rs>, like this very attractive city dressing for working women—easy to
               wear, but polished, meant to be taken seriously. David Hayes’s <rs type="color"
                  >black</rs>-and- <rs type="color">white</rs>
               <rs type="garment">suit</rs>, left: a body-close, pointed-edge <rs type="garment"
                  >jacket</rs> and short, narrow <rs type="garment">skirt</rs>, both in strongly
               textured <rs type="material">silk cloque</rs>—a look that moves from day into
               evening. About $460.</p>

            <p>Regimental precision—the <rs type="color">navy</rs>-and-<rs type="color">white</rs>
               stripes, right—of Gloria Sachs’s <rs type="material">silk</rs>
               <rs type="garment-piece">button-back</rs>
               <rs type="garment">blouse</rs> and classic <rs type="garment">trouser</rs>, all the
               raciness of a <rs type="garment">jumpsuit</rs>. <rs type="garment">Top</rs>, about
               $220. <rs type="garment">Trousers</rs>, about $290. And then there are patterns so
               precise, they give you a feeling of texture. Anne Klein’s starring <rs type="garment"
                  >jacket</rs>, left—long, clean, collarless—continues in <rs type="color"
                  >black</rs>-and-<rs type="color">white</rs>, perfect proportion with this short,
               slim <rs type="material">linen</rs>/<rs type="material">satin</rs>
               <rs type="garment">skirt</rs>; with <rs type="garment">trousers</rs>. Louis Dell’Olio
               for Anne Klein &amp; Co. <rs type="garment">Jacket</rs>, about $380; <rs
                  type="garment">skirt</rs>, about $160. <rs type="garment">Jewelry</rs>, Paloma
               Picasso for Tiffany &amp; Co.</p>

            <p>Another attractive <rs type="garment">jacket</rs>, right, by Mondi, in <rs
                  type="color">navy</rs>
               <rs type="material">gabardine</rs>, slightly more classic but not <rs type="garment"
                  >blazer</rs>-y—it’s longer, more relaxed, it moves. Here, over matching <rs
                  type="garment">trousers</rs>, a <rs type="color">white</rs>
               <rs type="garment">shirt</rs>. <rs type="garment">Jacket</rs>, about $209. <rs
                  type="garment">Trousers</rs>, about $160. <rs type="garment">Shirt</rs>, about
               $120. Hair, Edward Tricomi for Pipino-Buccheri, NYC; makeup, Laura Mercier. Details,

            <p>A STRONG SENSE OF EASE… THE SINGULAR CHARM OF A SOFT SUIT IN A STRONG MIX OF
               PATTERNS</p>

            <p>Usually hard to find: <rs type="garment">suit</rs> dressing that strikes the right
               balance between crispness and ease. You find it, opposite, in Oscar de la Renta’s
               striking plaid/check <rs type="garment">suit</rs> of <rs type="color"
                  >navy</rs>-and-<rs type="color">white</rs>
               <rs type="material">wool</rs>—the <rs type="garment">jacket</rs> lightly shaped and
               rounded; the <rs type="garment">skirt</rs> short, narrow, slit; the look sharpened by
               the jolt of a <rs type="color">red</rs>-and-<rs type="color">white</rs> striped <rs
                  type="material">silk</rs>
               <rs type="garment">blouse</rs>. About $1190. Late January at Saks Fifth Avenue; Sara

            <p>In a more dressed mood, this page, Bill Blass’s soft-falling <rs type="garment">7/8

                  <rs type="color">gray</rs>
               <rs type="material">silk</rs>, in a controlled, allover “palmette” print (fabric,
               Abraham) with a striped <rs type="material">silk</rs>
               <rs type="garment">halter</rs> that wraps at the waist (Blass, Telos). Gray at night,
               a pulled-together, charming way to look. About $2570. Late January at Saks Fifth
