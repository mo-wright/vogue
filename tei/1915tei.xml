         <p><note type="image"> Illustration of a woman wearing a checkered scarf, hat, and
               muff.</note></p>
         <p> Since skating bids fair to succeed dancing as a fas, a skating set of <rs
               type="material">velveteen</rs> and <rs type="material">chiffon</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs> is one of the most acceptable fights; <rs type="garment"
               >hat</rs>, $10; <rs type="garment">scarf</rs>, $15; <rs type="garment">muff</rs>,
            $40</p>
         <p><note type="image">Illustration of a woman wearing a white dress with colored linen
               suspenders.</note></p>
         <p> Something new is a combination of <rs type="color">white</rs> and colored <rs
               type="material">linen</rs> in a <rs type="garment-piece">suspender waist</rs> that
            launders beautifully; $2.95 </p>
         <p><note type="image">Illustration of a woman wearing a simple blouse with buttons, wearing
               a striped belt and plain skirt.</note></p>
         <p> Particularly good in a simple <rs type="garment">blouse</rs> is the new heavy <rs
               type="material">silk</rs> called <rs type="material">silk broadcloth</rs>; in <rs
               type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">flesh color</rs>; $5.95 </p>
         <p><note type="imge">Illustration of a woman wearing a striped scarf with a fluffy
               hat.</note></p>
            <p><rs type="color">Black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> striped <rs type="material"
               >velvet</rs> line with brilliant <rs type="color">green</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs> forms the <rs type="garment">scarf</rs> of a <rs
               type="garment">skating set</rs>; the <rs type="garment">hat</rs> is like the <rs
               type="garment">scarf</rs>, with a gay <rs type="material">worsted</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">trimming</rs>; <rs type="garment">hat</rs>, $12; <rs
               type="garment">scarf</rs>, $15 </p>
         <p>SIMPLE <rs type="material">crêpe de Chine</rs>
            <rs type="garment">negligées</rs> of the type illustrated at the lower left make most
            acceptable Christmas gifts, because they are practical, as well as attractive; <rs
               type="material">crêpe de Chine</rs> is the most serviceable of materials for this
            purpose.</p>
         <p>The model shown may be had in <rs type="color">pink</rs>, <rs type="color">blue</rs>, or
               <rs type="color">white</rs>
            <rs type="material">crêpe de Chine</rs>, or it may be had in other colors to order. The
               <rs type="garment">fichu</rs>, edged with a narrow <rs type="garment-piece">knife
               plaiting</rs> of the <rs type="material">crêpe de Chine</rs>, is practically the only
               <rs type="garment-piece">trimming</rs>. <note type="garment-piece">Knife
               plaiting</note> also appears at the <rs type="garment-piece">Empire waist-line</rs>
            in both front and back.</p>
         <p>The model sketched in the middle at the bottom of the page is also of <rs
               type="material">crêpe de Chine</rs>. The front is softly box plaited, and the back
            shows two groups of <rs type="garment-piece">box plaits</rs> at each side. Delicate <rs
               type="material">lace</rs> of a lovely pattern is used around the neck and to form the
            sleeves; the flowing coat of <rs type="material">chiffon cloth</rs> has <rs
               type="garment-piece">angel sleeves</rs>.</p>

         <p>A <rs type="garment">CAP</rs> AND A FLYAWAY <rs type="garment">PETTICOAT</rs></p>

         <p> With the <rs type="garment">negligée</rs> just described is a boudoir <rs
               type="garment">cap</rs> of <rs type="material">chiffon</rs><rs type="material"
               >cloth</rs> and <rs type="material">Binche <rs type="material">lace</rs></rs>. The
               <rs type="garment">cap</rs> is made entirely by hand and is trimmed with a <rs
               type="material">satin</rs>
            <rs type="material">rosette</rs> at each side, which is the only decoration. It may be
            had in <rs type="color">flesh color</rs>, <rs type="color">pink</rs>, or <rs
               type="color">blue</rs>
            <rs type="material"> chiffon cloth</rs>. <rs type="garment">Petticoats</rs> are so much
            in demand that the model at the lower right would be most acceptable to the girl who is
            fond of fluffy things . The top is made of soft <rs type="material"
                  ><placeName>French</placeName> taffeta</rs>, and the flounce is of <rs
               type="material">plaited chiffon</rs>, with a ruching at the bottom. <rs
               type="garment-piece">Bows</rs> and <rs type="garment-piece">streamers</rs> of <rs
               type="material">taffeta ribbon</rs> trim the <rs type="garment-piece">ruffle</rs>.
            The <rs type="garment">petticoat</rs> comes in <rs type="color">light colors</rs>.</p>
         <p> The <rs type="garment-piece">underbodice</rs> with the <rs type="garment"
               >petticoat</rs> has been made to order to match the <rs type="garment">skirt</rs>. It
            is of <rs type="material">ribbons</rs> and <rs type="material">plaited chiffon.</rs>
         </p>

         <p>PICTURESQUE SETS</p>

         <p>The two <rs type="garment"> skating sets</rs> illustrated on this page are most
            appropriate as Christmas gifts. The one at the upper left is of smart <rs type="color"
               >black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> checked <rs type="material"
               >velveteen</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs>
            <rs type="material">chiffon</rs>
            <rs type="material">velvet</rs>. The <rs type="garment">skating sets</rs> are exclusive
            designs of the shop which made them. </p>
         <p>The set sketched at the upper right is of a <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs

            <rs type="material">chiffon</rs><rs type="material">velvet</rs>. The <rs type="garment"
               >hat</rs> is of the same combination, with a <rs type="material">fur</rs> band and a
            gaily colored <rs type="material">worsted</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">decoration of fruit. </rs></p>
         <p> Very simple is the heavy <rs type="material">silk</rs>
            <rs type="garment-piece">waist</rs> in the second sketch from the upper right. The
            material is the new <rs type="material">silk</rs>
            <rs type="material">broad-cloth</rs>. <rs type="color">White</rs>
            <rs type="material">silk</rs> is used on the <rs type="garment-piece">collar</rs> and
               <rs type="garment-piece">cuffs</rs>.</p>
         <p>Second from the left is a <rs type="garment-piece">suspender waist</rs> in <rs

            and <rs type="color">white</rs>
            <rs type="material">linen</rs>. Hem-stitching marks the division of the materials. The
               <rs type="garment-piece">collar</rs> may be worn either open or closed. </p>
