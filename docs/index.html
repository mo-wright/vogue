                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>This project analyzes historic issues of <em>Vogue Magazine</em>, sourced from <a
                        href="https://archive.vogue.com">their historical archives</a>. </p>
                <p>We focused on the section <strong>“What She Wears.”</strong> Our XML markup
                    tracks how fashion details evolved from the 1890s to 1995. The process helped us slow down, notice small details, and understand how digital tools can bring new meaning to historical texts.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><em>Vogue</em> began in 1892 as a publication documenting New York society. Over
                    time, its fashion reporting reflected major cultural shifts.</p>
                <p>Natural fibers dominated early issues, while the mid-century introduced
                    synthetics, new shapes, and evolving fashion language.Studying this timeline allowed us to see how fashion isn’t just clothing — it’s storytelling about identity, trends, and social change.</p>

                <h2>Main Goal</h2>
                <p>We aim to show how <em>Vogue</em> shaped and reflected beauty standards over a
                    century of reporting. By marking up specific fashion choices, we created a clear picture of how trends developed, and how the magazine's language changed over time. This project allowed us to connect historical fashion with modern digital tools. </p>
