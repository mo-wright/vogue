            <h2>About the Team</h2>
            <p>
                Our team includes <strong>Tara, Molly, Trinity, and Miracle</strong>. 
                We all wanted to look at how fashion trends changed within <em>Vogue</em> over the years. 
                While working together, we each helped inspect different <em>Vogue</em> issues and label the 
                fashion details in XML—from fabrics and colors to specific garments.

            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                For our project, we focused on the <em>Vogue</em> section <strong>“What She Wears.”</strong> 
                We looked at issues from <strong>1895 through 1995</strong>, marking up each description 
                and illustration in XML to track what women were wearing in each decade.
            </p>
            <p>
                We tagged materials, colors, and garment types, which helped us see patterns across the century 
                and how they shifted. This let us understand how fashion—and the language <em>Vogue</em> used 
                to describe it—changed over time.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Vogue</em> began in <strong>1892</strong>, founded by <strong>Arthur Baldwin Turnure</strong>. 
                It originally started as a newspaper documenting New York’s high-society fashion and lifestyle.
                From the beginning, <em>Vogue</em> reflected more than clothing—it reflected what was happening 
                in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early descriptions, we noticed more natural materials like silk, wool, and cotton compared 
                to the synthetics we see today. Around the <strong>1950s</strong>, materials shift, hat styles evolve, 
                and feathers become less common. Beauty standards and cultural attitudes continue to change with 
                each decade.

            <h2>Main Goal</h2>
            <p>
                Our main goal is to show how <em>Vogue</em> documented the changing beauty standards over time. 
                By examining a century of “What She Wears,” we were able to see how people responded to fashion, 
                culture, and the expectations placed on women. Fashion always tells a story—and this project 
                allowed us to uncover that story across 100 years.
