Jewels abundant
[Around the text, a photograph of two bare feet, each with intricate amber jewel decoration. Colored jewels align the center.]
This is the newest makeup of the season - the Scheherazaderie leg. Beaming paillettes and gemmy flowers flashing to the tips of the toes, a modern fantaisie played on memories of Cleopatra's serpent sandals, so dense with jewels the thongs and laces were never seen... of the Indian beauty who adorned her legs with "jewels abundant"... of dancers in the Bakst-Diaghilev ballets
"Scheherazade" and "Dieu Bleu."
[Above the text, a leg, adorned in the same amber jewels and floral decoration]
The lotus foot "...place on this patch of flower-strewn floor your lotus foot, And let your foot through beauty win..." Jewelled and pampered, delicately arched and rogued--these were the feet of heroines and goddesses in twelfth-century India, the lotus feet that drew the smouldering admiration of heroes....
[Above and to the right of the text, photographs of feet. One has a piece of warm-toned jewelery around the ankle snaking to the big toe. The second has jewels in arch patterns.]
For Vogue, Elizabeth Arden's gifted makeup man - Pablo of Coty Award fame - designed these gala jewels patterns for heroines treading the lotus way right now. Paillettes and fake gems - attached one by one - trace sandal shapes on bare feet. The toenail lacquer is Flame by Elizabeth Arden
