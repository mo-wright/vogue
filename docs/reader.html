            <p>WHAT SHE WEARS</p>
            
            <p>GIFTS-THE BALL GOWNS OF 1896</p>
            
            <p> On brisk and gay the autumn has been with weddings, two of which were emphatically
               red-letter functions. Then followed the Horse Show, always a dashing affair-a gathering
               of smart men and women, fine horses and equipages, and showy parade of beauty and
               <strong>gowns</strong>,
               boxed off and ticketed for the gazing multitudes in genuine peep-show fashion. Men
               were
               in their best form, and came in for their innings fairly. Gallantry, grooming and
               good
               looks told with capital effect in the brilliant picture. Now comes the finish of our
               yearly race, with Christmas shopping on the tapis. We are all engaged at this moment
               in
               thinking much more about the presents we have to make, either from obligation or
               affection, than of what we are having made to wear, or planning to order in the near
               future, or wearing at the present moment. </p>
            
            <p>The world will bear witness that we are in our apparel as smart as possible; our street
               <strong>gowns</strong>, <strong>hats</strong>, <strong>furs</strong> and the rest as faultless and as fit as it is possible to have them.
               The only visible neglect is that we are quite late-and we always are in preparing
               for
               our toilettes de cérémonie. We shall have to do all that in a rush, as January is
               only
               three weeks off. But, apropos of the shopping and the gifts, whisper it not in Gath
               that
               books, pictures, silver, glass, china, etc., are to play a decided second fiddle,
               this
               year, to <strong>jewels</strong>, <strong>laces</strong> and <strong>furs</strong>, particularly the last of the trio. All my cousins and
               my aunts are talking <strong>fur</strong>, <strong>fur</strong>, <strong>fur</strong>. What wonder, when the creations are so lovely! A
               Christmas list reads off like a menagerie inventory. You will find <strong>seal</strong>, <strong>otter</strong>, <strong>monkey</strong>,
               <strong>beaver</strong> and <strong>bear</strong>; <strong>ermine</strong>, <strong>chinchilla</strong>, <strong>mink</strong>, the <strong>lambs</strong> of Persia and Thibet, <strong>fox</strong> and <strong>lynx</strong>.
               By the way, there is a new departure in making up <strong>lynx</strong> and <strong>fox</strong> in their natural
               skins.</p>
            
            <p> <strong>Lynx</strong> abounds in lovely coloring, the yellows paling into white, and the long hairs
               flecked with many shades of gray. Thibet is dyed every color, to match different <strong>cloths</strong>,
               and astrachan has gone a peg higher in exclusiveness than its once proud rival, Persian
               lamb, because the latter is now so well imitated by the manufacturers. The medley of
               <strong>furs</strong> now considered the chic thing has brought about a pooling of <strong>furs</strong> in families, by
               which elder daughters profit, and younger ones are better satisfied with newer purchases
               at less value. De gustibus non. </p>
            
            
            <p> Now for un petit mot about ball and <strong>dinner gowns</strong>, for the dinner-dance season is
               staring us in the face. We all know the succés of <strong>flowers</strong> and <strong>tulle</strong> last year, and we
               are glad to learn that both are to reign in ninety-six. All kinds of <strong>nets</strong>, <strong>gauzes</strong>,
               lisses, and the newest and sheerest of <strong>grenadines</strong>, flowered like watercolored pictures.
               I hope the débutantes at the coming Patriarchs will scorn <strong>silks</strong> and <strong>satins</strong> for their
               gowns and pay tribute to their own youth and beauty in <strong>tulle</strong>, the ideal <strong>frock</strong> for that</p>
            
            
            <p> Now for un petit mot about ball and dinner gowns, for the dinner-dance season is
               staring us in the face. We all know the succés of flowers and tulle last year, and
               we
               are glad to learn that both are to reign in ninety-six. All kinds of nets, gauzes,
               lisses, and the newest and sheerest of grenadines, flowered like watercolored pictures.
               I hope the débutantes at the coming Patriarchs will scorn silks and satins for their
               gowns and pay tribute to their own youth and beauty in tulle, the ideal frock for that
               enchanting occasion.</p>
            
            <p> The rosebud element will monopolize the strictly floral <strong>gowns</strong> they are theirs by
               natural right, but all young women, matrons or maids, it is to be hoped, will array
               themselves in them for the beauty and becomingness of this poetic fashion. </p>
            
            <p>As an example of devotion to a flower, the <strong>gown</strong> in question is trimmed with <strong>myosotis</strong> or
               <strong>forget-me-nots</strong>. There are two immensely full skirts of <strong>white</strong> <strong>tulle</strong> falling over a gupe
               of white soie de Lyons, and all three skirts are gathered on one band. The <strong>tulle</strong> skirts
               are hemmed, with a vine heading embroidered in <strong>white</strong> <strong>floss</strong>, exceedingly dainty and
               effective. The collet corsage, draped in <strong>double tulle</strong>, rises into a slight
               point, back and front, and is headed by a full garland of <strong>forget-me-nots</strong>, which form
               shoulder straps to the bodice. The sleeves are made of many thicknesses of <strong>tulle</strong> caught
               under the flowers on the shoulders and draped so as to expose the arm in front, and then
               draped fully into the armhole in a bouffant way. The sleeve is finished at the elbow by
               a band of a <strong>sky-blue</strong> <strong>velvet</strong>, matching the bouquets which are coquettishly fastened on
               the outside. garland of myosotis is worn round the throat, and connected from this
               gorgette to the décolletage are eight floral chains, slender and lovely; three in the
               back, three in the front, and short ones on each shoulder, which fit over the neck
               perfectly. The girdle is of <strong>sky-blue</strong> <strong>velvet</strong>, fastened in the back with a smart bow.
               <strong>white</strong> <strong>aigrette</strong>, supported by a knot of forget- me-nots, is posed a little to one side of
               the head, the hair being dressed in waves, rolled off from the face, and pretty,
               careless coils in the back running up into a little knot, with a drooping wave curled
               in
               the middle of the forehead.</p>
            
            <p> Another charming gown has floral effects derived from exquisite <strong>silk</strong> embroideries, the
               newest of the fine trimmings. A <strong>satin</strong> <strong>skirt</strong> is the foundation usually for these
               transparent draperies of <strong>tulle</strong> or <strong>gauzes</strong> favored by matrons young and beautiful. </p>
            
            <p>The skirt, in this instance, is cream-white satin, and the tulle overdress a
               pinkish-mauve, but instead of being hemmed is only doubled, then gathered at the waist,
               and afterward shirred a little distance, say nine or ten inches below, and drawn down
               snugly to the figure and tacked to the satin gupe. Two broad bands of silk embroidery,
               roses in every shade, start en tablier at the bottom of the tulle <strong>skirt</strong> and are
               graduated a little toward the waist, leaving space for a pointed <strong>girdle</strong> of the same
               embroidery to show between and encircle the waist in a narrow <strong>belt</strong>, fastening on the
               left panel with a <strong>bouquet</strong> of <strong>violets</strong>. Corsage bébé, V-shaped décolletage, headed by a
               broad band of this lovely lisse embroidery, with bouquet of violets on the left
               shoulder. <strong>White</strong> satin elbow sleeves draped with <strong>tulle</strong> so as to show the inner side of
               the arm, across which are two narrow straps of <strong>embroidery</strong>. Hair dressed low on the face,
               a few short curls in the back, and run through the top a superb <strong>jeweled hairpin</strong>, a
               triple <strong>diamond</strong> <strong>aigrette</strong>. The <strong>necklace</strong> is an almost invisible gold chain, from which is
               suspended three enormous <strong>jewels</strong>, a <strong>diamond</strong> in the centre, with <strong>ruby</strong> and <strong>emerald</strong> on
               sides.</p>

            WHAT SHE WEARS.
            
            <p> BEAUTIFUL BE-FEATHERED OPERA MATINEE HATS - ONLY BOX OCCUPANTS MAY DISPLAY THEIR
               HATS
               DURING PERFORMANCE - NATTIER MODEL COMMENDED COSTUMES FOR CALLING AN ESPECIALLY PRETTY
               SHORT SKIRT MODEL — BRONZE AND OLIVE GREENS POPULAR- UNDEFINED PLAIDSFEATHER
               ARRANGEMENTS </p>
            
            <p>An opera matinee is sure at all times to bring out the street fashions in strong force.
               Particularly true is it at the November opening, and this year it has proved a brilliant
               example. The beplumed <strong>hats</strong> assisted with telling effects. It is one thing to pass on the
               street these showy long plumes in <strong>white</strong>, in <strong>blue</strong>, in <strong>pink</strong> and <strong>yellows</strong>, and quite another
               to sit from two to three hours gazing at them from time to time. <strong>Feathers</strong> in tips seem
               to have almost disappeared. In half lengths they are now disposed at most audacious
               angles, and bunched up into threes or fives. They plunge out from the left side of
               <strong>velvet</strong> <strong>hats</strong> with upturned brims in a rearward direction that is most original. They rise
               from uptilted and very much trimmed backs of hats in stunning bravado. They cross
               the
               crowns of smart hats from one side almost to the other, and over, and sweep quite far
               forward upon others. As for the under brim <strong>feather</strong> linings, as well as the tosssed up
               crown groupings turning this way and that, they all bespeak a skill for posing, and a
               control over the <strong>feather</strong> that never has been as complete as it is this season. The pity
               of it all was to see these exquisite perishable creations taken off and held on the
               laps. The box contingent is in that respect to be envied for keeping the hat on the
               head.</p>
            
            <p>BOX HAT IN PINK</p>
            
            <p> The charming Nattier styles, and the very low crowned Watteaux should become a fixed
               opera and <strong>theatre hat</strong>, so easy are they to take off and put on, and of the least trouble
               to keep on one's lap, for plumes and <strong>feather</strong> trimmings rightfully belong to those in
               seats where hats may be worn on the head throughout the performance. Beautiful were
               many
               of the <strong>box hats</strong>. For instance, one in <strong>pink</strong> <strong>velvet</strong>, with a side tilt that seemed every
               moment to be losing its balance, had its brim lined with <strong>pink</strong> <strong>tinsel cloth</strong> covered with
               <strong>pink</strong> <strong>tulle</strong>. Five half length <strong>pink</strong> plumes toppled over its crown and hid it completely.
               The brim in the rear of the crown was also invisible, but in front there was a glimpse
               of it bent down upon the hair and on the right side. The shape of the head as well
               as
               the dressing of the hair counts for everything in hat styles of this character. Another
               irresistible fascinator was in <strong>white</strong> <strong>felt</strong>, and had its crown, which was rather high and
               covered with a fold drapery of <strong>straw-colored</strong> <strong>chiffon velvet</strong> further ornamented on the
               extreme edge in the back with a long and compact bunch of <strong>silvery white</strong> aigrettes
               spreading backward with a dash. The right side edge of the brim of this hat almost
               touched the beauty's eyebrow, while on the left, the uptilt showed off the whole head.
               At the same marvellous angle was posed a <strong>white silver </strong> <strong>cloth</strong> creation, showing its sheen
               only upon the brim. The crown was extremely large, having a wrinkled drapery of <strong>pale
                  blue</strong> <strong>velvet</strong> very full and gracefully disposed. In the most picturesque manner were
               France <strong>roses</strong> in their dainty <strong>pinkness</strong>, grouped into a garland on the left, a few <strong>roses</strong>
               swinging below the brim line on that side which was abridged for that particular effect
               evidently. For pure coquetry no hat has ever excelled it. </p>
            
            <p>NEW COIFFURE</p>
            
            <p> One <strong>coiffure</strong> there was that stood out from all the rest on a recent night performance.
               It consisted of two large <strong>scarlet</strong> and <strong>white</strong> <strong>velvet tiger lilies</strong> grouped with two or
               three <strong>dull green</strong> <strong>velvet leaves</strong>, and a Paradise plume of <strong>silvery whiteness</strong> springing from
               the midst. This <strong>coiffure</strong> was posed slightly out of the middle line on the back of the
               head (the hair being dressed high), but leaning a trifle toward the left side. A copy
               it
               is said to be of a <strong>coiffure</strong> worn at the popular French play called La Belle Madame
               Héber. It marks a new departure, taking the place of a <strong>theatre hat</strong>. </p>
            
            <p>There seems to be no chance, however, this season to oust the famous large <strong>picture hats</strong>,
               or the smaller styles just described. What may happen in the autumn of 1906 remains
               to
               be seen.</p>
            
            <p>SMART THINGS HIGH-PRICED</p>
            
            <p> If ever there was a time when so-called poor relations might joyfully accept presents
               of things wearable, it is undoubtedly this year. The advance in prices for really
               smart
               <strong>hats</strong>, <strong>costumes</strong>, <strong>evening wraps</strong>, <strong>sets</strong> of <strong>furs</strong>, or of <strong>ostrich</strong> and <strong>marabou</strong> puts the
               small-income sisters, aunts and cousins of the rich in quite a trying situation. No
               small economies can overcome the rise to the fabulous sums that are asked at the smart
               places. </p>
            
            <p>HALF TAILORED STREET COSTUMES</p>
            
            <p> <strong>Street costumes</strong> for forenoon wear are worn short, and will be. But there are <strong>cloth
                  costumes</strong> only half-tailored, which are quite elaborate, and expensively trimmed, the
               skirts of which are long. These are, of course, specially intended to pay visits in,
               or
               to wear upon any ceremonious occasion. Ladies' or <strong>chiffon cloths</strong> in single colors are
               for these, the best style. The length of the <strong>skirt</strong> indicates that the wearer, if she
               walks, must take it up. Hansom and cab-hire has become so general nowadays that few
               will
               be inclined to go through the weariness of carrying their <strong>skirts</strong> in the grasp of the
               hand. Many dressy <strong>cloths</strong> and <strong>velveteens</strong> in short-skirted <strong>costumes</strong> mark the independence
               of those who are to make their calls afoot in the season. </p>
            
            <p>A <strong>SHORT SKIRT</strong> MODEL</p>
            
            <p> When a choice has to be made among the short-skirted tailor-mades the many models
               shown
               are so charming that it becomes a difficult matter to order. There are complex designs
               that appear quite simple in the sober colors, but are very ornate in <strong>cloths</strong> of lighter
               shades. A long tab design, cut in one piece with the yoke or with the Princess girdle top
               , is extremely graceful, as full plaits are set in to suit the figure or lessened as
               the demand arises. Braids to match the cloth or glossy <strong>black</strong> <strong>silk</strong> ones in some way or
               another enter into the bottom <strong>skirt trimming</strong>. It is kept in most cases quite low on the
               bottom, and not at all conspicuous, the main object being not to detract from the
               length
               of skirt line. Passementerie motives are introduced with soutaches, while wider braids
               produce of themselves sufficient effect. </p>
            
            <p>BODICE TREATMENT</p>
            
            <p> The close-fitting <strong>bodices</strong> receive color bits upon their revers, mostly very small ones,
               or have flat shapes in color laid on about the neck, lower down upon the belt, and both
               in front and in the back, as well as upon the bottom of the sleeves. Buckle ornaments
               are put in pairs upon the <strong>belts</strong> or as an ornament on the top of princess girdles both
               back and front. This finish is a very smart one. All the <strong>bodices</strong> keep up either Eton or
               <strong>bolèro</strong> suggestions. A few exceptions adopt the basque line or the postilion, but these
               are not found among the younger slim figures. Shoulders are, or should be, kept on broad
               lines; there is no style without that feature in tailor-mades. Some sleeves have less
               fulness than others at the top. Both long and elbow sleeve lengths are worn. </p>
            
            
            <p> Among some extremely late coming tailor models long sleeves prevail, <strong>Lace</strong> <strong>chemisettes</strong>
               give rise to openings at the neck that are exceedingly becoming, and stands for no
               end
               of smartness in these costumes. </p>
            
            <p><strong>BRONZE</strong> AND <strong>OLIVE GREEN</strong></p>
            
            <p> As the season advances <strong>bronze</strong> and <strong>olive green</strong>s increase in color distinction among the
               <strong>cloths</strong> and <strong>velvets</strong>. An example in <strong>olive green</strong> in the finest of <strong>cloth</strong>, had for trimming,
               an inch and a half <strong>black</strong> <strong>brocade</strong> <strong>galoon</strong>. It was a <strong>two-piece suit</strong>, a closed Eton and
               skirt. This galoon from shoulders to hem in front gave long lines in even rows, the
               <strong>cloth</strong> between being cut into a flat flap, which raised itself sufficiently to keep the
               width of the <strong>galoon</strong> intact In the back these long lines were pre-served, giving a
               tapering effect to the waist which was belted in with cloth to match, but also had
               shaped oblong applications of light <strong>grayish-blue</strong> <strong>velvet</strong>, over which were motives of
               <strong>black</strong> <strong>silk</strong> <strong>passementerie</strong>. A turn-over collar, now the accepted finish of all the best
               tailor-mades, and in this instance it was not wanting. It was also of <strong>blue</strong> <strong>velvet</strong>,
               over-applied with <strong>black</strong> <strong>passementerie</strong>. The bottom of the sleeves repeated the same
               ornamentation, while upon the fronts of the Eton, on the bust line, were two <strong>black</strong>
               pieces similarly treated. Charming indeed was this trimming effect, while the <strong>galoon</strong> in
               its glossy flatness seemed to be woven into the <strong>cloth</strong>, so admirably was it sewed and
               pressed. </p>
            
            <p><strong>TOBACCO-BROWN</strong> COSTUME</p>
            
            <p> Of the utmost attractiveness was a <strong>tobacco-brown</strong> <strong>cloth</strong> costume, short skirted, as well,
               with a low crutch design separating the plaits, and in the same brown shade as the
               cloth. On one edge of this <strong>brown</strong> <strong>silk</strong> Hercules braid was a narrow raised <strong>brown</strong> <strong>satin</strong>
               <strong>cord</strong> gimp, which, when sewed on, gave a special accent to the long crutch lines that ran
               up from the bottom, and were lost in their diminutive ending. A panel front had the
               <strong>cloth</strong> cut into graded crescent lengths from top to bottom, a darker shade of <strong>brown</strong> <strong>silk</strong>
               showing underneath. Crescent was finished by the narrowest <strong>cord</strong> inlet and stitched to
               flatness. </p>
            
            <p>The same trimming displayed itself upon the sides of the sleeves from shoulder to cuff,
               and gave a yoke line back and front, in three graded rows beautifully proportioned in
               their size. A touch of <strong>gold</strong> <strong>galoon</strong> brightened up the turn-over <strong>brown</strong> <strong>velvet</strong> collar, as
               it did the straight cuff pieces; while a glimpse of both <strong>velvet</strong> and <strong>gold</strong> suggested an
               inner <strong>vest</strong> line in perfect harmony. All the fastenings in front were quite invisible. </p>
            
            <p> INDEFINITE PLAIDS </p>
            
            <p>Those almost undefined <strong>plaid</strong> cloths in <strong>greens</strong> or <strong>bronze</strong> with <strong>red</strong>dish and <strong>dark blue</strong>ish
               shad-braids of <strong>silk</strong>en <strong>black</strong>ness are twisted into a telling design upon each side of this
               straight band. A Norfolk style of short belted-in <strong>coat</strong>, with a <strong>red</strong> <strong>cloth</strong> collar and
               cuffs, the <strong>black</strong> braid again used as trimming and a few gilt buttons laid upon the <strong>belt</strong>
               and the fronts produce a markedly good and out-of- the-common style.</p>

            <p>SIMPLE <strong>crêpe de Chine</strong>
               <strong>negligées</strong> of the type illustrated at the lower left make most
               acceptable Christmas gifts, because they are practical, as well as attractive; <strong>crêpe de Chine</strong> is the most serviceable of materials for this
               purpose.</p>
            
            <p>The model shown may be had in <strong>pink</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, or
               <strong>white</strong>
               <strong>crêpe de Chine</strong>, or it may be had in other colors to order. The
               <strong>fichu</strong>, edged with a narrow knife
               plaiting of the <strong>crêpe de Chine</strong>, is practically the only
               trimming. Knife
               plaiting also appears at the Empire waist-line
               in both front and back.</p>
            
            <p>The model sketched in the middle at the bottom of the page is also of <strong>crêpe de Chine</strong>. The front is softly box plaited, and the back
               shows two groups of box plaits at each side. Delicate <strong>lace</strong> of a lovely pattern is used around the neck and to form the
               sleeves; the flowing coat of <strong>chiffon cloth</strong> has angel sleeves.</p>
            
            
            <p>A <strong>CAP</strong> AND A FLYAWAY <strong>PETTICOAT</strong></p>
            
            
            <p> With the <strong>negligée</strong> just described is a boudoir <strong>cap</strong> of <strong>chiffon</strong><strong>cloth</strong> and <strong>Binche <strong>lace</strong></strong>. The
               <strong>cap</strong> is made entirely by hand and is trimmed with a <strong>satin</strong>
               <strong>rosette</strong> at each side, which is the only decoration. It may be
               had in <strong>flesh color</strong>, <strong>pink</strong>, or <strong>blue</strong>
               <strong> chiffon cloth</strong>. <strong>Petticoats</strong> are so much
               in demand that the model at the lower right would be most acceptable to the girl who
               is
               fond of fluffy things . The top is made of soft <strong>French taffeta</strong>, and the flounce is of <strong>plaited chiffon</strong>, with a ruching at the bottom. Bows and streamers of <strong>taffeta ribbon</strong> trim the ruffle.
               The <strong>petticoat</strong> comes in <strong>light colors</strong>.</p>
            
            <p> The underbodice with the <strong>petticoat</strong> has been made to order to match the <strong>skirt</strong>. It
               is of <strong>ribbons</strong> and <strong>plaited chiffon.</strong>
               </p>
            
            
            <p>PICTURESQUE SETS</p>
            
            
            <p>The two <strong> skating sets</strong> illustrated on this page are most
               appropriate as Christmas gifts. The one at the upper left is of smart <strong>black</strong> and <strong>white</strong> checked <strong>velveteen</strong> and <strong>red</strong>
               <strong>chiffon</strong>
               <strong>velvet</strong>. The <strong>skating sets</strong> are exclusive
               designs of the shop which made them. </p>
            
            <p>The set sketched at the upper right is of a <strong>black</strong> and <strong>white</strong> striped <strong>velvet</strong>, lined with a
               brilliant <strong>green</strong>
               <strong>chiffon</strong><strong>velvet</strong>. The <strong>hat</strong> is of the same combination, with a <strong>fur</strong> band and a
               gaily colored <strong>worsted</strong>
               decoration of fruit. </p>
            
            <p> Very simple is the heavy <strong>silk</strong>
               waist in the second sketch from the upper right. The
               material is the new <strong>silk</strong>
               <strong>broad-cloth</strong>. <strong>White</strong>
               <strong>silk</strong> is used on the collar and
               cuffs.</p>
            
            <p>Second from the left is a suspender waist in <strong>pink</strong> and <strong>white</strong>, or <strong>blue</strong>
               and <strong>white</strong>
               <strong>linen</strong>. Hem-stitching marks the division of the materials. The
               collar may be worn either open or closed. </p>

            <p>That Show the Modern Spirit of the Animated</p>
            
            <p>Fashion of the Flare</p>
            
            
            <p> (Left) The fulness and the pointed cut of the deep cape on this velvet wrap give it its
               animation</p>
            
            
            <p>On these three models, the motion of the mode is obtained in three ways-by swinging
               jabots on the velveteen frock at the left, by circular cut in the broadcloth model in
               the middle, and by the wide semicircular front of the velours coat at the right </p>
            
            
            <p>FLARES that spring from the front, the side, or the back, the circular swing of coats,
               the sweep of new capes, the flying lines of the jabot and the scarf, have all called
               into being a new mode--the mode of motion. The straight silhouette of past seasons
               was
               inert, static. The new, flared line is a living, moving, modern thing. The rough
               sketches on these two pages, showing clothes that smart women are wearing now,
               illustrate this theme of motion. The unfinished lines of these sketches, which have
               not
               as yet settled into repose, express the ever-shifting grace of the mobile silhouette.
               This is the impression presented by the new flaring fashions. Every step, every move
               displaces a godet, a pleat, a drapery, and sets astir a new dynamic rhythm.</p>
            
            <p>It has been a long time making its way-this mode of motion. This winter marks its
               first
               general acceptance. We clung for a long time to the straight, restricted line, because
               it gave us so little trouble. It was young. It was simple. It was smart because it
               was
               simple and young. And, as long as we kept to it tenaciously, we could not go very
               far
               wrong.</p>
            
            <p>But what has this new flared line to offer to offset the security of the old, familiar,
               tube-like silhouette? Vogue believes that it has a great deal to give in the furthering
               of a more progressive mode. Its first great advantage is its comfort. The straight
               line
               was made for standing still in a strenuous world keyed to motion. The flared line
               is
               designed for easy, unrestricted action. The new silhouette makes us less self-conscious
               about our clothes-walking, sitting, dancing-and more conscious of a new and exhilarating
               freedom and grace. Moreover, as long as the straight silhouette dominated clothes,
               the
               mode itself could not go forward. When two seams made a dress, what was left to
               encourage the invention of a Vionnet, who works with fabrics as a sculptor moulds
               his
               planes? What was left to stimulate the plastic skill of a Jean Patou, the kinetic,
               or
               made-for-motion, designs of a Lucien Lelong, the genius of all the designers to whom
               the
               making of clothes is an art expressive of its age?</p>
            
            <p> Within the new conception of the flare, there is no end to the variations that are
               possible. The precisely tailored tweed frock, with its concealed pleats that flare only
               in motion, the chiffon dress with its flying scarfs and floating panels, are both in the
               same modern spirit. But each meets in its own way the demands of its fabric and the
               needs of the occasion for which it is especially intended. Not only does the flared
               silhouette give a wider scope to the designer, but it offers more individuality to
               the
               woman who wears it. While the straight line was becoming to the great majority-to
               the
               average woman and the average figure-,it had little to give to the exception. The
               woman
               whose charm is her dignity comes into her own this year, because she chooses the type
               of
               flare that will emphasize that quality. On the other hand, the slight, young girl
               now
               wears the new moulded lines, clinging and then flaring, short and free, to accent
               every
               lithe line. She adopts the Greek grace of a Diana, not of a Minerva-and the new mode
               offers both. The tall woman chooses clothes that will tend to shorten the effect of
               length. Even a short woman finds the particular kind of flowing lines that will make
               her
               look less square. The skilful use of flares can be made to bring out one's good points
               and to minimize less fortunate ones.</p>
            
            <p>With the coming of the flare, we begin a new era of individuality-altogether modern,
               a
               little dangerous, and always interesting. There is no longer any single formula for
               chic. And just how the flare is to be adapted to its time and to its wearers is a
               story
               to be continued in many more issues of Vogue in the weeks to come.</p>

               Many happy returns to the Debutante Party 
               (even without the old fine “careless rapture”). There is hardly one Debutante who
               does not
               include, in her daily schedule, work for some of the great relief needs, college
               course, Nurse Aid or Day Nursery work. But over this layer of serious ideas and genuine
               good works there is again this year the light but delicious frosting of debutante
               parties. Most of them will again be the great group presentation balls which were
               wartime
               innovations but there will be a few individual parties. The debutante this year may
               still not have a seven man escort as her mother might have had ; she will quite probably
               rush down for college for her own debut; there will be fewer fittings, fewer debutante
               luncheons, much, much less flurry. And although clothes may seem less important to
               her
               than to her pre-war debutante predecessors , she will probably manage to affix her
               personal signature to her own wardrobe; will know that it is not “ how many” but “how
               memorable” that really matters, when she chooses her clothes. With her beautiful <strong>white</strong>
               Coming Out <strong>party dress</strong> this season a debutante may wear a short <strong>crimson</strong> <strong>velvet</strong> or
               <strong>duvetyne</strong> <strong>coat</strong>. Wear <strong>wrist-length gloves</strong> in <strong>white</strong> , and carry a tight little <strong>white</strong> <strong>furs</strong>
               (opposite page). If it is not her coming out party,she will probably choose a
               colour. When it is not a party, but just a small dancing <strong>evening dress</strong> again, this season
               … <strong>black</strong> perhaps...bare on top as her debut dress.

            <p>Part of the fashion idiom: “easy dressing”—meaning dressing that’s unstudied,
               uncomplicated, easy to wear… all in an attractive, polished, real-life way. The
               concept’s American. We started it. We do it best. And we keep doing it better. This
               season, “easy” goes to a whole new level—racier, sharper, more sophisticated. What
               does it: fabric with more character, patterns with more strength, more precision…

            <p>The best of these patterns, when they aren’t in strong color, are in strong black
               or
               navy with white, like this very attractive city dressing for working women—easy to
               wear, but polished, meant to be taken seriously. David Hayes’s black-and-white suit, left: a body-close, pointed-edge jacket and short,
               narrow skirt, both in strongly textured silk cloque—a
               look that moves from day into evening. About $460.</p>
            
            
            <p>Regimental precision—the navy-and-white stripes, right—of Gloria Sachs’s silk button-back blouse and classic trouser, all the raciness of a jumpsuit. Top, about $220. Trousers, about
               $290. And then there are patterns so precise, they give you a feeling of texture.
               Anne Klein’s starring jacket, left—long, clean, collarless—continues in
               black-and-white, perfect proportion with this short, slim linen/satin skirt; with trousers. Louis Dell’Olio for Anne Klein &amp; Co.

            <p>Another attractive jacket, right, by Mondi, in navy
               gabardine, slightly more classic but not blazer-y—it’s longer, more

            <p>Usually hard to find: suit dressing that strikes the right balance between crispness
               and ease. You find it, opposite, in Oscar de la Renta’s striking plaid/check suit of navy-and-white wool—the
               jacket lightly shaped and rounded; the skirt short, narrow, slit; the look sharpened
               by the jolt of a red-and-white striped silk blouse.

            <p>Part of the fashion idiom, “easy dressing”—meaning dressing that’s unstudied,
               uncomplicated, easy to wear… all in an attractive, polished, real-life way. The
               concept’s American. We started it. We do it best. And we keep doing it better. This
               season, “easy” goes to a whole new level—racier, sharper, more sophisticated. What
               does it: fabric with more character, patterns with more strength, more precision…
               color!</p>
            
            
            <p>There’s a new character to Ralph Lauren’s sportive American classics, like his
               traditional <strong>trousers</strong>, this page, are in a bold floral
               print of <strong>silk</strong>, and his shawl-collared <strong>robe</strong> is vivid
               <strong>purple</strong> in soft, languorous silk charmeuse. Another plus:
               these looks needn’t wait for warm weather, a resort—this is terrific at-home dressing
               any time. <strong>Trousers</strong>, about $358. <strong>Robe-jacket</strong>, about $658. Late Dec. at Saks Fifth

            <p>Everybody loved the look, the Fred Astaire nonchalance of Ralph Lauren’s impeccable,
               classic <strong>trousers</strong>, in brilliant chrome <strong>silk charmeuse</strong>, opposite. Here, played against a <strong>navy</strong>
               double-breasted wool gabardine jacket and <strong>white</strong> <strong>tank</strong>.

            <p>Typical of this “laid back” American approach: very polished <strong>sweater</strong>-and-<strong>skirt</strong>
               dressing for low-key evenings. And what a <strong>sweater</strong>-and-<strong>skirt</strong> this is! By Ralph Lauren,
               this page, a long, soft-moving, bias-cut skirt of <strong>flag-red</strong> <strong>silk
                  crepe de Chine</strong> with a generously sized <strong>navy</strong> <strong>cotton</strong> <strong>turtleneck sweater</strong>. The
               <strong>turtleneck</strong>—so important this winter—keeps evolving for warm weather, with 
               long sleeves, short sleeves, even on halters. <strong>Skirt</strong>, about $258. <strong>Sweater</strong>, about $198.
